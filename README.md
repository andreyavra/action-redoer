# Action Redoer by Andrey Avramenko

License included

Run `logger.py`, and you have 5 seconds delay to get to where you want the keyboard and mouse recording to start. The logger works for all actions except scrolling. These actions are then stored in the `log.andreyiscool` file. 

To re-run the actions you made, run `doer.py`. You have 5 seconds to navigate to where you want the program to start operating. The `doer.py` program is reusable for the same log file - you don't have to make a new log file each time you run this.
